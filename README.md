# Overview


Project Goal:

To create a basic Java program that simulates a simple hotel reservation system.
Key Features:

Room Management:
Represents hotel rooms with attributes like room number, type, price, and availability.
Allows for adding new rooms to the hotel.
Reservation Management:
Allows users to search for available rooms based on room type and dates.
Enables users to make reservations for available rooms.
Calculates the total price of a reservation based on the number of nights stayed.
(Simulates) payment processing.
Basic User Interface:
Provides a simple menu-driven interface for user interaction.
Allows users to choose between searching for available rooms and making reservations.
Prompts the user for necessary input (room type, dates, guest name, etc.).
Date Handling:
Includes a helper method to parse date strings into Date objects.
Error Handling:
Includes basic error handling for invalid input (e.g., invalid date format).
Project Structure:

Uses a class-based approach with the following classes:
Room: Represents a single hotel room.
Reservation: Represents a reservation made by a guest.
Hotel: Represents the hotel itself, containing a list of rooms and reservations.
Limitations:

Simplified: This is a basic implementation and lacks many real-world features.
No Database: Hotel data and reservations are not stored persistently.
No Payment Integration: Payment processing is simulated; no actual integration with payment gateways.
Basic User Interface: The user interface is very basic and could be significantly improved.
Limited Error Handling: Error handling is basic and can be expanded to cover more scenarios.
Further Enhancements:

Data Persistence: Store hotel data and reservations in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for persistence.
Payment Integration: Integrate with a real payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure payment processing.
User Authentication: Implement user registration and login for personalized experiences.
GUI: Create a more user-friendly GUI using a framework like Java Swing or JavaFX.
Advanced Features: Add features like loyalty programs, discounts, special offers, cancellation policies, and more.
Improved Error Handling: Enhance error handling to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages.
Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the code.
